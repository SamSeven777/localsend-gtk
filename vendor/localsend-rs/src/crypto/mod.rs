/// Call this before constructing any `reqwest::Client` or rustls config.
///
/// Every rustls-facing dependency of this crate is pinned to its
/// "-no-provider" spelling so that `aws-lc-rs` — ~1.2 MiB of assembly that no
/// code path here executes — stays out of the binary. The trade-off is that
/// reqwest then has no built-in provider to fall back on: its
/// `ClientBuilder::build()` **panics** if the process default is unset. This
/// function is the guard against that, so it must run ahead of every client or
/// server construction.
///
/// Idempotent and thread-safe. `install_default()` returns `Err` once a
/// provider is already installed, which is the expected steady state.
